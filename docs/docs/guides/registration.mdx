# Registration

[Commands](commands.mdx) and [Types](types.mdx) must be registered in order to be used.

## Commands

In order to register commands, you must use the `register` method.

This will load any `ModuleScripts` in the provided `Instance`.

Any methods that are decorated with `@Command` will be registered, as long as its
parent class is decorated with `@Commander`.


```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    registry.register(script.Parent.commands)
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```

## Types

To register types, you can use the `registerType` or `registerTypes` method.

```ts showLineNumbers
// You can register a single type like this
registry.registerType(someType)

// You can also register multiple types at once!
registry.registerTypes(someType, someOtherType)
```

You can also organise your types into ModuleScripts:

```ts showLineNumbers title="types/other.ts"
import { BaseRegistry } from "@rbxts/commander"

// ...

export = (registry: BaseRegistry) => {
    registry.registerTypes(someType, someOtherType)
}
```

Then register them the same way you would with commands:

```ts showLineNumbers title="runtime.server.ts"
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    registry.register(script.Parent.types)
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```

## Summary

- Commands are registered using `register`
- Types are registered using `registerType` or `registerTypes`
- Types can be organised into ModuleScripts by:
    - Exporting a function that takes a `BaseRegistry` and registers types
    - Using `register` to register each module in the given `Instance`
