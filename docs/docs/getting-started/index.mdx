# Getting Started

**Commander** is a flexible and extensible command framework for roblox-ts that makes defining commands easy
and readable.

## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" default>

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @rbxts/commander
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Yarn">

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add @rbxts/commander
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm add @rbxts/commander
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Starting Commander

Commander needs to be started **once** on the client and server.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="client" label="Client" default>
To start Commander on the client, you'll need to provide some extra options if you want to use
its user interface.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderClient.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        // The app that will be used to display the Commander UI
        // Commander comes with a default app, but you can create your own
        app: CommanderApp,

        // The default key is F2, but you can change it here
        activationKeys: [Enum.KeyCode.F2]

        // The maximum terminal and command history length, default length is 1000
        historyLength: 1000

        // If you don't want to register the built-in types, you can change this option
        registerBuiltInTypes: true
    }
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="server" label="Server">
```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start(
    (registry) => {
        // Register commands or types here
    },
    {
        // If you don't want to register the built-in types, you can change this option
        registerBuiltInTypes: true
    }
).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Registration

The way commands and types are registered is the same on the server and client.

```ts showLineNumbers
CommanderServer.start((registry) => {
    // Register commands by loading all command ModuleScripts under an Instance
    // You can also use this for types: ModuleScripts that export a function
    // will be called with the registry object, allowing you to do any
    // registration there.
    const commandContainer = script.Parent.commands;
    registry.register(commandContainer);

    // If you've already loaded the command ModuleScripts
    // (e.g. through Flamework.addPaths) you can register
    // them like this:
    registry.registerCommands();

    // Type objects are registered like this:
    registry.registerType(someType);
    registry.registerTypes(someOtherType, anotherType);
}).catch((err) => warn("Commander could not be started:", tostring(err)));
```

See the [Registration](/guides/registration.mdx) guide for more details on how these methods work.
