# Installation

## roblox-ts

Commander requires **roblox-ts**. An installation guide can be
found in its [documentation](https://roblox-ts.com/docs/setup-guide).

## Commander

Commander is not yet available! A release will be coming soon.

If you want to use it in the meantime, you may install it by cloning the repository and generating
a tarball using `npm pack`. You can then install Commander using this file, e.g. `npm install (tgz file path)`.

Keep in mind that this project has planned features that will be implemented before the initial release, so
I would recommend waiting for a release instead.
